<H1>The Best Movie According to Project</H1>
    <H2>These following are the top 3 movies and their reviews </H2>

<H3> THE SUPER MARIO BROs. MOVIE</H3>
    <P>If you’re a kid who spends half your time on a Nintendo Switch and the other half watching cartoons, 
        there is plenty in Super Mario Bros to satisfy. If you’re the parent of such a kid, 
        who are you to tell them what they should and shouldn’t be enjoying?</P>
    
        <P>Crisp animation, mostly strong voice acting and fun for the entire family. 
            No doubt Mario is a juggernaut franchise for Illumination and Universal. 
            But overall, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is nothing groundbreaking 
            from an animation or film standpoint.</P>

<H3>SUZUME</H3>
    <P>Suzume is another step in the brilliant career of a filmmaker,
        who seems closer and closer to reaching narrative and aesthetic maturity.</P>
    
    <P>It's a film filled with creative ideas, and too many of them are left unaddressed 
        by the time the credits roll... 
        [But] Suzume is still a fun movie with cute moments.</P>

<H3>THE DARK KNIGHT</H3>
    <p> An incomparable crime thriller and superhero film, and an instant classic in both genres</p>
    <p> With his smeared whiteface make-up and leering razor-slashed smile, 
        Ledger's Joker is creepy enough to look at, 
        but what he represents is even more chilling. </p>
